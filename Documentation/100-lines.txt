# INTRODUCTION

Apache NuttX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an emphasis on
standards compliance and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 64-bit
microcontroller environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are
POSIX and ANSI standards. Additional standard APIs from Unix and other
common RTOSs (such as VxWorks) are adopted for functionality not available
under these standards, or for functionality that is not appropriate for
deeply-embedded environments (such as fork()).

Extensive documentation can be found on the project wiki:
  <https://cwiki.apache.org/NUTTX/NuttX>

For brevity, many parts of the documentation will refer to Apache NuttX as
simply NuttX.
